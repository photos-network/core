- Group photos by their content like people or objects

It is responsible for main tasks e.g.:

- **Authentication** (validate the identity of users)
- **Authorization** (handle access privileges of resources like photos or albums)
- **Plugin Handling** (extend the feature-set by plugins)
- **Persistency** (read / write data)
- **Task Processing** (keep track of running tasks)



## üß© Contribution

This is a free and open project and lives from contributions of the community.

See our [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)



## üß™ Development

The core is written in ü¶Ä [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) and highly customizably by using a Plugin-system.



#### üìÑ Documentation

With the nightly version of `cargo doc` an additional index-page will be created.
```shell
$ RUSTDOCFLAGS="--enable-index-page -Zunstable-options" cargo +nightly doc --all --no-deps --document-private-items --all-features
```



#### üî¨ Testing

An continuous check on all files is done in the background and will trigger `cargo test` on each file change.

```shell
$ cargo watch --exec test
```

To run tests for all crates in this workspace, run:
```shell
$ cargo test --workspace --all-targets
```
