# OAuth Authorization Server

This crate offers an **OAuth Authorization Server** for [Photos.network](https://photos.network).

Especially for data privacy or offline support, this can interact as its own authorization server to handle user accounts locally without using any third-party authorization like Google, Okta or Microsoft.
