[Photos.network](https://photos.network) is a free and open source, privacy first, self-hosted photo storage and sharing service for fediverse.

Its core features are:

- Upload photos and videos without resolution or quality constraints
- Filter / Search photos by attributes like location or date
- Group photos by their content like people or objects
- Share photos with friends, family or public


## Core

This repository contains the **core** system of the project.
It is responsible for main tasks e.g.:

- **Authentication** (validate the identity of users)
- **Authorization** (handle access privileges of resources like photos or albums)
- **Plugin Handling** (extend the feature set by plugins)
- **Persistency** (read / write data)
- **Task Processing** (keep track of running tasks)



## ðŸ§ª Development

The core is written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) and highly customizably by using a Plugin-system.


#### ðŸ“„ Documentation

With the nightly version of `cargo doc` an additional index-page will be created.
```shell
$ RUSTDOCFLAGS="--enable-index-page -Zunstable-options" cargo +nightly doc --all --no-deps --document-private-items --all-features
```

#### ðŸ”¬ Testing

With the following command, an continuous check on all files is done in the background and will trigger `cargo test` on each file change.

```shell
$ cargo test --workspace --all-targets
```



### ðŸ“œ Roadmap (MvP)

 - Authenticate via openID
 - Create a new media item

 - *RAW (image support for RAW-images)
 - *Resize (create low-resolutions / thumbnails)
 - *Deep learning (image recognition, Reinforcement learning)
 - *Plugin System (extract features into plugins)
